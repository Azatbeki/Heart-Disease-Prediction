## Overview

This project aims to **predict the risk of heart disease** using a dataset of health records. We leverage machine learning techniques and data visualization to identify key risk factors and develop a predictive model that can help in early detection and preventive healthcare strategies.

## Key Features

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
✅ Feature engineering to extract relevant information  
✅ Building and tuning a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier  
✅ Achieved an accuracy of **87%**  
✅ Visualizations to highlight **key risk factors** such as ST slope and exercise-induced angina  

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-risk-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-risk-prediction

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

5. Open the Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb file and run the cells to explore the project.

## Results

The **KNN model** achieved an accuracy of **87%**, effectively classifying patient health records and highlighting risk factors that are most correlated with heart disease.

**Key factors identified:**

- ST slope  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- Oldpeak (depression induced by exercise)  
- Chest pain type  

These insights can guide healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and personalizing treatment plans.
